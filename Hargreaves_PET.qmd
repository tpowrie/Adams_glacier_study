## Calculation of Hargreaves PET for Adams watershed

First we will sort downloaded from ClimateBC:

```{r}

setwd("C:/Users/taypo/OneDrive/Documents/Grad Studies/Graduate Research/mDMC/Adams Raster Files"
)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
